Stroke Predictor
- Project Type: Classification 
    - Classifiying people based on whether they had a stroke or not in a certain dataset. Eventually want to make a web app that can tell a person whether they are at risk for a stroke based on inputs they give us about themselves

Why
Building a predictor like this is quite straightforward but very useful at the same time. I have never seen or had anyone in my life get a stroke but I imagine it is terrible and if our project can help someone to take better care of their health if they seem to be at risk for a stroke, then this project will be a success.
